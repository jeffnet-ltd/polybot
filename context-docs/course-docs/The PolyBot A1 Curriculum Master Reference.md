### ✅ Your Validation Checklist

When I generate a new module map for you, cross-reference it with this list to ensure:

1. **Is the Grammar explicit?** (Does it teach the underlying rule, e.g., "The Imperative" for Directions?)
    
2. **Is the Vocabulary relevant?** (Does it fit the theme?)
    
3. **Is the Boss Fight Valid?** (Does the "Can-Do" goal match the module theme?)
    
4. **Is it A1?** (Ensure no complex past tenses or hypothetical conditionals are introduced yet).
