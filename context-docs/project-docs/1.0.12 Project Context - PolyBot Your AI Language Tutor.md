Version: 1.0.12 (Production Ready: Llama 3 & Multi-Platform Scope)

Status: Development - Stable Chat Flow & Production Readiness

Last Updated: 2025-11-29

Dev Environment: HP EliteBook 820 G4 / Windows 11 WSL2 (NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti - Docker Desktop with GPU Support)

## Executive Summary

Polybot is an **AI-powered multilingual language learning platform** that runs entirely locally. It provides structured conversational practice based on the **CEFR** curriculum.

The platform has successfully migrated to the Llama 3 model for robust multilingual chat and features stable, goal-driven conversational flows, maintaining the core value proposition of private, effective language practice.

## Core Value Proposition (Login Screen/Value Proposition Screen Context)

- **Core Differentiator:** True **bilingual learning**—users receive explanations in their native language while conversing solely in the target language.
    
- **Structured Curriculum:** Learning is based on the **CEFR** standard, providing clear, structured progress tracking.
    
- **Privacy & Speed:** The AI model runs **entirely locally** on the user's GPU (NVIDIA CUDA), providing near-instant response times and ensuring maximum data privacy.
    
- **Gamification:** Users can earn **XP** and progress through interactive lessons (Flashcards, Matching, Sentence Building).
    

## Technical Architecture

### Deployment Scope: Multi-Device (App Conversion)

The application is built on a **React/FastAPI stack**, making it highly adaptable:

- **Primary Target:** Web application optimized for desktop and tablet browsers (using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness).
    
- **Future Scope (App Conversion):** The React frontend is suitable for conversion to a **cross-platform desktop application** (e.g., Electron) or a **mobile/tablet application** (e.g., React Native/Capacitor bridge with local backend) to run on all major devices.
    
- **Local AI Core:** The core backend (`FastAPI` + `Llama 3`) is designed to run locally, ensuring consistent performance regardless of the host operating system (Windows/Linux/macOS).
    

### Stack Overview

```
Frontend: React 18.2.0 + Tailwind CSS + Lucide React
Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11) + Llama 3 AI (Instruct Tuned)
Database: MongoDB 7.0
Infrastructure: Docker + Docker Compose (V2) - Docker Desktop (WSL2 Backend)
AI Model: Llama 3 8B Instruct (Loaded on NVIDIA CUDA GPU using device_map="auto") 
```

## Resolved Critical Issues (V1.0.13)

|**Issue**|**Resolution**|
|---|---|
|**AI Model Limitation**|**RESOLVED.** Migrated from BLOOMZ 3b to **Llama 3 8B Instruct**. This provided reliable instruction adherence and resolved initial language drift (Bambara/Manding error).|
|**Chat Initiation**|**RESOLVED.** AI initiates with a friendly, blended greeting and question (e.g., "Ciao! Come ti chiami?").|
|**Chat Progression / Goal Completion**|**RESOLVED.** Implemented a **Goal-Driven Guardrail** that reliably checks for the simplified core communicative action: the learner **stating their name** (`Mi chiamo Jeff`).|
|**Grammar Feedback UX**|**RESOLVED.** Implemented a non-interruptive grammar correction system using a **hover-over pop-up** on the user's message bubble.|
|**Quiz UX / Score Integrity**|**RESOLVED.** All interactive exercises implement a **UI lock** after the first answer attempt for accurate scoring.|
|**UI Responsiveness**|**RESOLVED.** Fixed overflow error in `MainScreen` to ensure menus and layout elements are correctly positioned across desktop breakpoints.|

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Conversation Goals (Multi-Step):** Evolve the goal guardrail to track multi-step completion (e.g., _Goal 1: State Name_, _Goal 2: State Origin_), awarding XP for each successful step.
    
2. **Vocabulary Expansion:** Integrate the existing vocabulary list into the chat flow logic to ensure the AI guides the learner to utilize unpracticed terms.
