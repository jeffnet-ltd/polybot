**Version:** 1.0.13 (Production Ready: Llama 3, Google Auth, & Polished UX) **Status:** Development - Stable & Production Ready **Last Updated:** 2025-11-29 **Dev Environment:** HP EliteBook 820 G4 / Windows 11 WSL2 (NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti - Docker Desktop with GPU Support)

## Executive Summary

Polybot is an **AI-powered multilingual language learning platform** that runs entirely locally. It combines structured CEFR-based curriculum with free-flowing AI roleplay to provide a "True Bilingual" learning experience.

**Key Differentiator:** Users learn in their target language while receiving explanations and UI support in their native language. The AI runs locally (Llama 3 8B), ensuring total privacy and zero latency.

## Technical Architecture

### Stack Overview

- **Frontend:** React 18.2.0 + Tailwind CSS + Lucide React
    
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11) + **Llama 3 8B Instruct** (via Hugging Face `transformers`)
    
- **Auth:** **Google OAuth 2.0** (via `authlib`) + Local JWT/Session Management
    
- **Database:** MongoDB 7.0
    
- **Infrastructure:** Docker + Docker Compose (V2) - Docker Desktop (WSL2 Backend)
    

### Hardware Requirement

- **AI Model:** Llama 3 8B Instruct loaded with `device_map="auto"` and `bfloat16` precision on NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

## Resolved Critical Issues (V1.0.13)

|Component|Issue|Resolution|
|---|---|---|
|**AI Core**|Model Limitation|**RESOLVED.** Migrated from BLOOMZ 3b to **Llama 3 8B Instruct**. Fixed prompt adherence and multilingual context handling.|
|**Authentication**|Social Login|**RESOLVED.** Implemented **Google OAuth 2.0** flow. Backend now securely handles token exchange and user creation. Added "New User" detection to trigger onboarding.|
|**UX / Navigation**|Language Switching|**RESOLVED.** Added a top-bar **Language Switcher** with flag emojis. Switching languages now **automatically redirects** the user to the _Lessons_ page for immediate engagement.|
|**Data Integrity**|Input Validation|**RESOLVED.** Restored validation in the Setup Screen to prevent users from selecting the same language for both Native and Target settings.|
|**Chat Experience**|Initiation & Flow|**RESOLVED.** AI now initiates chat with a friendly, blended greeting (e.g., "Ciao! Come ti chiami?"). Goal completion is triggered by a simplified check (State Name), preventing infinite loops.|
|**Feedback UI**|Correction Display|**RESOLVED.** Implemented non-interruptive grammar corrections via a **hover-over pop-up** on user messages.|
|**Lesson UI**|Scoring|**RESOLVED.** All interactive exercises (Match, Arrange, Flashcard) now **lock the UI** after the first attempt to ensure accurate scoring.|

## Core Features & User Flow

1. **Registration/Login:**
    
    - Social Login (Google) or Standard Email/Password.
        
    - **Smart Onboarding:** New users (or those with 0 XP) are automatically routed to the _Language Setup_ screen to select their Native and Target languages.
        
2. **Dashboard (Main Screen):**
    
    - Displays progress (XP, Words Learned, Streak).
        
    - **Sidebar:** Shows current profile with Flag Icons (e.g., 🇮🇹 from 🇬🇧).
        
3. **Curriculum (CEFR A1):**
    
    - Structured lessons (Greetings, Introductions).
        
    - Interactive Exercises: Flashcards, Fill-in-the-blank, Sentence Building, Matching.
        
4. **AI Tutor (Boss Fight):**
    
    - **Scenario:** "Introduce Yourself".
        
    - **Mechanism:** AI starts the chat. User responds. AI assesses progress (Guardrail) and corrects grammar (Correction Prompt) in real-time.
        
    - **Completion:** Successfully stating name triggers "Mission Complete" and awards XP.
        

## Next Steps (Roadmap)

1. **Multi-Step Conversation Goals:** Evolve the AI Guardrail to track complex, multi-part goals (e.g., _Goal 1: Name_ → _Goal 2: Origin_ → _Goal 3: Hobby_).
    
2. **Mobile App Conversion:** Package the React frontend into a native container (Capacitor/React Native) for iOS/Android deployment.
    
3. **Voice Integration:** Add Speech-to-Text (Whisper) for voice input in the chat.
