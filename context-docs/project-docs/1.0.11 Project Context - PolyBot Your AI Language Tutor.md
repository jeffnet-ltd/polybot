Version: 1.0.11 (Llama 3 Migration & Goal Completion Fix)

Status: Development - Stable Chat Flow & Production Readiness

Last Updated: 2025-11-28

Dev Environment: HP EliteBook 820 G4 / Windows 11 WSL2 (NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti - Docker Desktop with GPU Support)

## Executive Summary

Polybot is an **AI-powered multilingual language learning platform** that runs entirely locally. It provides structured conversational practice based on the **CEFR** curriculum.

**Key Differentiator:** True bilingual learning - users learn in their target language while receiving explanations in their native language.

**Current Status:** The platform is fully functional. The AI model has been successfully migrated to Llama 3 for better language adherence. All interactive lessons now enforce an attempt lock for accurate scoring. The new goal-driven chat flow is confirmed stable, featuring a friendly, active initiation and reliable completion condition.

## Technical Architecture

## Resolved Critical Issues (V1.0.11)

|**Issue**|**Resolution**|
|---|---|
|**Chat Initiation**|**RESOLVED.** AI now initiates with a blended, friendly greeting and question (e.g., "Ciao! Come ti chiami?"). Code was fixed to use the full language name to prevent model drift (Bambara/Manding error).|
|**Chat Feedback / Progression**|**RESOLVED.** Implemented a **Goal-Driven Guardrail** in FastAPI. The success condition was simplified to require the learner to **only state their name** (`Mi chiamo Jeff`) for reliable and immediate goal completion.|
|**Quiz UX / Score Integrity**|**RESOLVED.** All interactive exercises (`ArrangeExercise`, `MatchExercise`, Multiple Choice) now implement a UI lock after the first answer attempt, ensuring score and proficiency data accurately reflects the user's initial knowledge.|
|**AI Model Limitation**|**RESOLVED.** Migrated from BLOOMZ 3b to **Llama 3 8B Instruct**. This solved the core issue of prompt adherence and dramatically improved multilingual chat performance.|

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Conversation Goals (Part 2):** Now that the single-step goal works, refine the logic to guide the learner through a **multi-step checklist** (e.g., _Goal 1: State name_, _Goal 2: State origin_, _Goal 3: Ask a question_), awarding XP for each successful step.
    
2. **UI for Corrections:** The AI's correction logic is currently removed (in favour of conversational guiding). Re-introduce a clean UI component for displaying **optional, hover-over grammar corrections** during the chat without interrupting the flow.
