## Scenario-Based Practice Mode (Planned - V2.0)

### Architecture Overview

**Status:** 🎯 Designed - Ready for Implementation

The Practice Mode (replacing "Practise (AI)") implements a **Game State Architecture** rather than a simple chatbot, solving the "blank page problem" where learners don't know what to say to an open-ended AI tutor.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Scenario-Based Learning:** Users engage in realistic, contextual conversations (e.g., "Ordering Coffee at a Café", "Buying a Train Ticket") rather than free-form chat
2. **Mode Separation:** Strict separation between **Voice Mode** (🎙️) and **Text Mode** (💬) to prevent cognitive interference (Redundancy Effect)
3. **Game Loop Architecture:** Structured conversation flow with clear win conditions and feedback phases

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Stage Manager Pattern (Topic Control)

**Problem:** LLMs naturally drift off-topic during roleplay conversations.

**Solution:** Structured System Prompt that acts as a "Stage Manager" defining:
- **Current Scene:** Context and setting
- **Winning Condition:** Goal that ends the interaction
- **Constraints:** Response length, topic boundaries

**Example System Prompt:**
```
"You are roleplaying as a Barista in a busy Italian café.
Current Scene: The user is a customer ordering a cappuccino and a cornetto.
Your Goal: Take their order, ask if they want it 'al banco' (at the bar) or 'al tavolo' (at the table), and calculate the total price.
Constraints: Keep responses short (under 20 words). If the user changes the topic (e.g., asks about the weather), politely bring them back to the order."
```

**Drift Prevention:** Backend appends invisible reminder to prompt history before LLM call:
```
[System Note: focus on the coffee order; do not discuss unrelated topics.]
```

#### 2. Goal Check Classifier (Ending Detection)

**Problem:** LLMs never naturally "stop" talking - conversations can continue indefinitely.

**Solution:** "Hidden Thought" Method - Request structured JSON output from Llama 3 Instruct containing both internal state and external speech.

**JSON Response Format:**
```json
{
  "thought": "The user has successfully ordered and paid. The interaction is complete.",
  "scene_status": "COMPLETE",
  "reply": "Ecco a lei. Buona giornata!"
}
```

**Backend Logic:**
- Parse JSON response
- If `scene_status == "COMPLETE"`: Display success modal, end voice recording, trigger feedback phase
- If `scene_status == "ACTIVE"`: Continue conversation loop

#### 3. Post-Game Report (Feedback System)

**Design Philosophy:** No real-time corrections during roleplay (breaks immersion). Feedback provided after conversation completes, like a video game "Mission Report."

**Feedback Architecture:**

**Pronunciation Analysis:**
- Uses Whisper STT confidence scores from client-side
- Levenshtein distance metric for phonetic scoring
- Flags low-confidence transcriptions (e.g., "connetto" instead of "cornetto")

**Grammar & Vocabulary Review:**
- Entire conversation transcript sent to Llama 3 with review prompt:
  ```
  "Review this transcript. Find 3 grammatical errors and suggest 2 better vocabulary words for a beginner learner."
  ```
- Separate system prompt for feedback generation (different from roleplay prompt)

**Contextual Vocabulary Introduction:**
- Scenario-specific vocabulary priming via prompt injection
- Example: "Buying a Train Ticket" scenario ensures words like "binario" (platform) and "biglietto" (ticket) appear naturally
- LLM can explain vocabulary within context when user asks, improving retention vs. flashcards

#### 4. Voice Mode vs. Text Mode Separation

**Cognitive Science Rationale:** Mixing reading/typing with listening/speaking triggers "Redundancy Effect" - learners default to reading when text is visible, stopping active listening practice.

**UI Implementation:**
- **Toggle Switch:** `[ 🎙️ Voice Mode ] ↔ [ 💬 Text Mode ]` at top of Practice screen
- **Mode Isolation:** Each mode has distinct interface and backend endpoints

**Technical Architecture:**

**Voice Mode Endpoint** (`/api/voice-chat`):
- **Input:** Audio file (MediaRecorder API)
- **Process:** Whisper STT → Llama 3 (with Game State) → StyleTTS 2 TTS
- **Output:** Audio file
- **GPU Operations:** STT + LLM + TTS (expensive, isolated)

**Text Mode Endpoint** (`/api/text-chat`):
- **Input:** Text string
- **Process:** Llama 3 only (with Game State)
- **Output:** Text string
- **GPU Operations:** LLM only (cheap, fast)

**Transcript Bridge:**
- When Voice Mode conversation completes, transcript automatically saved
- User switches to Text Mode → System message: "Here is the transcript of your voice conversation. Review your mistakes below."
- Enables review without breaking mode separation

### Game Loop Flow

```
1. User Speaks → Whisper STT (transcription)
2. Backend Analysis → Check if "Winning Condition" met (via JSON scene_status)
3. Response Generation:
   - If COMPLETE: Generate closing line + Generate "Mission Report" (Feedback)
   - If ACTIVE: Generate Character Response
4. Audio Playback → StyleTTS 2 TTS (Voice Mode) or Text Display (Text Mode)
5. Loop continues until scene_status == "COMPLETE"
6. Post-Game Report displayed with pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary feedback
```

### Push-to-Talk Implementation

**Component:** `PushToTalkButton` (React)
- **Hold-to-Record:** MediaRecorder API (existing implementation)
- **Visual Feedback:** Button state changes during recording
- **Release-to-Send:** Audio sent to `/api/voice-chat` endpoint
- **Walkie-Talkie UX:** One-way communication prevents interruption
